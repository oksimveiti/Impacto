      <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
      <h3>
        1. Terms and Conditions
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Users must read and agree to the app’s terms and conditions, which outline the rights and responsibilities of
          both
          the
          user and the app developers. This ensures that users understand how the app operates and the rules governing
          its
          use. By
          agreeing, users acknowledge their commitment to abide by these terms while using the app.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
        2. Privacy Policy
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Users must review and consent to the app’s privacy policy, which details how their personal information will
          be
          collected, used, and protected. This includes information on data storage, sharing practices, and user rights
          regarding
          their data. Agreeing to the privacy policy is crucial for ensuring that users are informed about their data
          security and
          privacy.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
        3. Age Verification
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Users must confirm that they are at least 13 years old, or the minimum age required by applicable local laws.
          This
          condition is important for compliance with legal regulations, such as the Children’s Online Privacy Protection
          Act
          (COPPA) in the United States. Users may need to provide proof of age if requested.
        </li>
      </ul>


      <h3>
        4. Profile Information
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Users are required to provide their full name as part of their profile information. This helps to establish a
          sense of
          community and accountability within the app. Users should also specify their preferred language for app
          communication,
          ensuring that they can fully engage with the platform in a language they understand.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
        5. Social Media Integration (optional):
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Users may choose to link their social media accounts (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) to facilitate a smoother
          sign-in
          process
          and enhance sharing capabilities. This integration allows users to quickly connect with friends and community
          members,
          promoting engagement and collaboration on social issues.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
        6. Location Access (optional):
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Users may grant permission for location access, enabling the app to provide tailored information about events
          and
          actions happening in their vicinity. This feature is essential for real-time event organization and map
          functionalities,
          helping users stay informed about local initiatives and opportunities to participate.
        </li>
      </ul>
